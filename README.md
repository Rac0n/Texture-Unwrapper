# Texture Unwrapper

A Flutter project to unwrap your textures after using Texture Packer.

Long ago, I made a game which used Texture Packer to compress its assets, creating a sprite sheet out of several single sprites and a json file that had the information needed to use the sprite sheet.

However, now, I found myself needing the single assets, which I had lost. I created this Flutter project as a way to get the single sprites I needed and I am sharing it now if someone else will ever need it.

Feel free to take the code and improve it.
